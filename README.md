# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Prophet-and-Neural-Networks
This project compares advanced time-series forecasting methods using Facebook Prophet and an LSTM neural network. It includes synthetic data generation with seasonality, trend, and external regressors, model tuning, feature engineering, and rolling-origin cross-validation to identify the most accurate model.
